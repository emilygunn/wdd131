                <p>
                    <b>Name:</b> Lilthet Suncatcher (she probably had many nicknames but usually only family members or close friends know them, maybe eventually the party members)<br><br>

                    <b>Race and Class:</b> Centaur; Cleric, lots of spells and being kinda bulky for a spellcaster it's kinda fun.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Background:</b> She comes from a relatively small traveling band of centaurs full of merchants and some warriors to protect them. Huge family and knows quite a lot of random customs from different lands because of the travels. Known in her village as basically their chosen one and had a lot of pressure to live up to that image. This is because the god Heliod blessed/choose her at birth. She is now in this quest as basically a coming of age ceremony to show her who she is supposed to be and who she will become.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Good; she strives to always do the right thing and shys away from unnecessary death. Loves to try to bring people together and wants to bring Sunshine to everyone she can!<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Deity or Patron:</b> Heliod; she technically didn't choose him, he choose her, but she believes in all that he stands for but thinks he can be pretty arrogant at times and can understand why others do not like him.<br><br>
                
                    <b>Personality Traits:</b> Loyal to a fault, easy to trust but not stupid she won't let others get away with everything. Very emotionally driven.<br><br>

                    <b>Motivation:</b> She is on her Coming of Age Journey to seek who she will become and to live up to her tribes expectations that she will be a renowned champion of Heliod.<br><br>

                    <b>Appearance:</b> A really tall Clydesdale Centaur with a pale sandy colored coat. A long blonde braid for her hair and tail. Enjoys wearing light blues and yellows in her clothing. Many bags and packs since she cann carry so much. A large staff with Heliod symbols, other Heliod symbols on her necklace and clothing as well as wearing a laurel around her head.<br><br>

                    <b>Fun Fact:</b> She feels super pressured almost constantly to keep people together and ensure success. Also weird Nyxborn stuff like her hair and eyes sometimes have a glow and her hair can sometimes float, as well as having birds chirp when she laughs.<br><br>

                    <b>One-Liner: (Optional)</b> "Okay, how about we all take a seat and calm down to talk about this? I have the special talking stick!"

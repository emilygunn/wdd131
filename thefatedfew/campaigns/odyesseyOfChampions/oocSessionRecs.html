                    <b>Session Recap:</b><br><br>
                    We arrived on a volcanic island, off to seek the blessing of Purphoros for a compass that Kuul had helped create. This compass would then be able to guide us on our quest. <br><br>
                    We brought Tharros along with us, another follower of Purphoros, to hopefully help us through. Well... he gave us a few potions of healing and that was it, but we did make it through. We had to give offerings of "flame or forge" to statues in order to get inside the temple of Purphoros. <br><br>
                    Once inside, we explored the several rooms, solving puzzles and finding strange yet interesting items in chests. We also came across strange creatures that appeared from the flames of candles. A fight broke out between us and them... and Fatespinner started acting weird. He attacked me after the creatures were gone and almost killed me. I had to leave the room while the others tackled him to calm him down. He somehow acted even more weird after that.<br><br>
                    We managed to all <em>stay alive</em> and make it through more of the temple avoiding lava and solving another puzzle. We acquired a book called "Forging Faith" which Kuul used to blast through the doors. Yes, the book shot out a beam of fire. Then, for some reason, Fatespinner tackled me and tied me up to "protect me", honestly what is up with that man? Kuul then randomly decided to use the book to prevent the rest of us from following while he ran ahead.<br><br>
                    Great teamwork, I know.<br><br>
                    Finally <em>all</em> making it to the final chamber, we end up fighting a fire elemental to prove our worth and get the compass blessed by Purphoros. Woo Hoo we did it. Now back to the ship. <br><br>
                    Aaand then we remembered Tharros. We kinda left him on the island. <br><br>
